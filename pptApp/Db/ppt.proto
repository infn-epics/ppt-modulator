# StreamDevice Protocol File for PPT Modulator Binary TCP Stream
# Total data size: 43 words (86 bytes)

# ============================================================================
# Binary format specifiers used:
# %#s = skip/discard # bytes from input
# %{H} = read unsigned short (16-bit) in little-endian format
# The {} format converter handles binary integer conversions

# ============================================================================
# NOTES:
# ============================================================================
# - Each protocol skips N bytes with %Ns, then reads one 16-bit word with %{H}
# - %Ns format: skips/discards N bytes from input stream
# - %{H} format: reads unsigned short (16-bit) using binary converter
#   H = unsigned short, little-endian (standard on x86/x86_64)
# - StreamDevice caches the last device response, so all passive records triggered
#   by FLNK chain read from the same cached 86-byte buffer (single TCP read)
# - All values come from the same device response (atomic snapshot)
# - No need for calc records or byte manipulation in database
# - Values are automatically converted to EPICS native format (double)
